# Adaptive Applications Cookbook

## Adaptive Application Vision
We see a world where each of your applications continuously adapts to its changing environment.

* It [automates](automation/README.md) redundant processes for greater efficiencies. 
* It expands and contracts based on [performance](performance/README.md) needs. 
* It protects itself, [securing](security/README.md) points of vulnerability. 
* And by mining all these data points, it gets smarter, [insightful](insight/README.md), becomes self-healing, and evolves even more quickly. 

In our vision, your applications learn to take care of themselves&mdash;leaving you free to focus on delivering extraordinary digital experiences that inspire customers, keep them safe, and increase loyalty.
