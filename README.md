# Adaptive Applications Cookbook

## Adaptive Application Vision

Adaptive Applications bring intelligence and real-time changes to the world of application deployments, which today are mostly static and manual.
Adaptive Applications utilize an architectural approach that can rapidly respond with little to no human interaction to changes in the breadth and sophistication of cyberattacks, security posture, end-user demand, application performance, global availability, and condition across one or more infrastructure environments.
These apps are enabled by a near-real-time collection of live application and security telemetry, guided by service management policies, analyzed by ML/AI techniques, and harnessed to automation toolchains to rapidly adjust infrastructure and security controls to change conditions.

Adaptive Applications ultimately empower customers to securely innovate and deliver extraordinary digital experiences to their end users.
Specifically, Adaptive Application benefit customers in four ways:
1. More rapidly detect and neutralize [security](1-security) threats
2. Improve application [performance](2-performance) and resilience
3. [Speed deployments](3-speed-deployments) of new apps
4. Easily [unify policy](4-unify-policy) across on-prem, public cloud, and edge environments
